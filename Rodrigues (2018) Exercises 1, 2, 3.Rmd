This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


Exercise 1

Load the LaborSupply dataset from the Ecdat package and answer the following questions:
```{r}
install.packages("Ecdat")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
library(tidyr)
library(Ecdat)
data(LaborSupply)
head(LaborSupply) 
str(LaborSupply)
```
Compute the average annual hours worked by year (plus standard deviation)

``` {r}
# ("lnhr" = log of annual hours worked)

# mean hrs worked by year:
mean_hoursBYyear <- aggregate(LaborSupply$lnhr, by = list(year = LaborSupply$year), mean)
mean_hoursBYyear

# SD hours worked by year:
SD_hoursBYyear <- aggregate(LaborSupply$lnhr, by = list(YEAR = LaborSupply$year), sd)
SD_hoursBYyear

# 4.1 (Rodrigues, 2018)
          
```

What age group worked the most hours in the year 1982?
``` {r}
LaborSupply1 <- LaborSupply %>% filter(year==1982) %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  mutate(WorkHrsByAge=sum(lnhr))%>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(WorkHrsByAge==max(WorkHrsByAge))
LaborSupply

# The 34-year old age group worked the greatest amount of hours in 1982, with a  mean of 270.4

```
Create a variable, n_years that equals the number of years an individual stays in the panel. Is the panel balanced?
``` {r}
# Observations range from 1979 to 1988
# So number of years an individual stays can range from 1-10
LaborSupply %>% group_by(id) %>% mutate(n_years=n())

# It looks like all stay in for 10 years?
# That's probably incorrect. I'll return to this later.

```
Which are the individuals that do not have any kids during the whole period? Create a variable, no_kids, that flags these individuals (1 = no kids, 0 = kids)
``` {r}
LaborSupply3 <- LaborSupply %>% group_by(id) %>% 
  mutate(totalkids=max(kids)) %>% mutate(no_kids=if_else(totalkids == 0, 1, 0))
LaborSupply3
# column "no_kids" shows 0 for individuals with kids at some point throughout the study and 1 for individuals with no reported kids throughout the study

```
Using the no_kids variable from before compute the average wage, standard deviation and number of observations in each group for the year 1980 (no kids group vs kids group).
``` {r}
LaborSupply4 <- LaborSupply3 %>% group_by(no_kids) %>% filter(year==1980) %>% summarise(mean(lnwg), sd(lnwg), n())

LaborSupply4

# For individuals with kids, the average wage was 2.59 (sd=0.39) in 1980.
# For individuals without kids, the average wage was 2.68 (sd = 0.42) in 1980.

```
Create the lagged logarithm of hours worked and wages. Remember that this is a panel.
``` {r}
